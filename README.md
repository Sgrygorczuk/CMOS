This repository stores the work done for the Integrated Circuits EE 457 class, in this class we had to use the Electric program to create the schematics and layouts of logic circuits and with the help of LTSpice we would test the results for the propagation delay. The two major projects being an 8 Bit Carry Adder and a 32 Bit Carry Look Ahead adder.
